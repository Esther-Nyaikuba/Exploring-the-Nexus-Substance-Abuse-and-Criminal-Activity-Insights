# Drug Abuse Exploring the connection between substance Abuse and diverse criminal Activities

## Business Understanding
### Project Overview
Non-Governmental Organization want to address a critical issue, the escalating criminal activities ostensibly linked to substance abuse. 

### Business Problem
Insight Analytics Solutions has been approached by a Non-Governmental Organization eager to address a critical issue: the escalating criminal activities ostensibly linked to substance abuse. This organization has noted a marked escalation in crimes such as theft, assault, and vandalism, presumed to be connected to drug addiction within their jurisdiction. 
However, they find themselves without the requisite tools and insights to fully comprehend the dynamics and nuances of this alarming issue. 

### Objectives
- **Data Integration and validation:** Establish robust data integration processes to compile and validate diverse datasets related to substance abuse and criminal activities, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
 
- **Descriptive Analysis:** Perform descriptive data analysis to summarize key statistics and metrics related to drug-related crimes.
 
- **Frequencies, location trends, and drug types involved.**
 
- **Trend Identification:** Identify and document temporal trends in drug-related crimes, such as seasonal variations or long-term increases or decreases, using time-series analysis.
 
- **Location Analysis:** Conduct location-based analysis to pinpoint geographical hotspots of drug-related criminal activities, supporting focused law enforcement efforts.
 
- **Data Visualization:** Develop clear and intuitive data visualizations, such a charts, graphs, using  Excel to present analytical findings for easy interpretation by stakeholders.
   
## Data Understanding
The data for this project consists of 10,000 rows with 19 columns.

### Tech Stack
Excel will be used for this project, by utilizing its built-in features for data filtering, sorting, and pivot tables to explore trends and relationships within the data. 
Additionally, Excel's charting capabilities can help visualize patterns and summarize key insights from the dataset.

## Project Scope
A. Data Collection: Gather data related to substance abuse and criminal activities from various sources, Organize this data into structured Excel spreadsheets for analysis.
 
B. Data Cleaning and Validation: Conduct thorough data cleaning procedures with Excel to address issues such as missing values, duplicate entries, and formatting inconsistencies.
 
C. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize Excelâ€™s built-in statistical functions and tools to perform descriptive data analysis. Calculate key summary statistics, for crime frequencies, drug types, and demographics.
 
D. Data Visualization: Develop Excel - based data visualizations, Ensure that reports are structured for easy consumption by decision-makers.

### Insights
- **Trend of crimes in 2022:** Crime incidents saw a peak in December and then the lowest number of crime in a month was recorded in January.
- **Crime Types:** Theft is the common crime, followed by burglary and assault.
- **Incident by Location:** Most incidents occur in urban areas, with downtown and suburban areas showing relatively similar counts. Rural areas have the fewest incidents/crimes.
- **Gender Statistics:** Males are involved in a significant majority of incidents, representing 69% of the total.
- **Age group data:** The majority of incidentsinvolve individuals in the 26-38 and 39-59 age groups.
- **Police Activity:** Most incidents occur while the police are responding, with fewer during investigating and patrolling.
- **Drug Incidents:** Cocaine and Marijuana related incidents are the highest with their counts being close.
- **Daily Incident Distribution:** Incidents are fairly evenly distributed across the days of the week with slight peaks on weekends.
- **Police response by Location:** Urban areas have a higher police response in all categories (investigating, patrolling,responding) compared to suburbs and rural areas.
- **Drug type and conviction:**  For most drug types, the number of incidents where individuals were not convicted exceeds those where they were convicted.
- **Income and Incidents:**  Low income individuals are involved in the highest number of incidents followed by middle-income and high income individuals.


## Recommendations
- **Crime Prevention:** Given the high incidents of theft, consider launching public awareness campaigns and community policy initiatives specifically targeting theft prevention.
- **Urban Area Focus:** Allocate more police resources and surveillance to urban areas due to the high number of incidents.
- **Youth Engagement:** Develop youth engagement programs to address  the high involvement of the  26-38 age group in incidents.
- **Police patrol Strategy:** Re-evaluate patrolling strategies especially since most incidents occur during responding periods.
- **Drug Rehabilitation:** Given the high numbers of Cocaine and marijuana-related incidents, consider introducing or expanding drug rehabiltation and counseling services targeting these specific drug users.
- **Low-income Areas:** Special attention and resources should be directed towards low-income areas or demographics as they are involved in the highest number of incidents.
- **Legal System Review:** The high number of non-convictions across various drug types suggests a need to review and potentially reform aspects of the legal system or the evidence-gathering processes.
- **Community Policing:** Encourage community policing and community watch programs, especially in high incidence areas.
- **Data Continuation:** Continually update and review the dashboard to adapt strategies and interventions based on changing trends and patterns.
- **Gender-Specific programs:**  Given the higher male involvement in incidents, consider gender-specific interventions or programs targeting males.
